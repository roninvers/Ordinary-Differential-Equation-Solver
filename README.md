Hereâ€™s a professional, informative `README.md` for your Streamlit ODE Solver project. This template is ready to use and highlights your appâ€™s features, usage, and deployment:

# ðŸ“ˆ ODE Solver Web App

A powerful and user-friendly web application for solving **ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of any order** using a variety of popular numerical methods. Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for interactive scientific computing.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

[![Open in Streamlit]([https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg](https://ordinary-differential-equation-solver-version-1.streamlit.app)

- **Supports ODEs of any order:** Enter your ODE as a system of first-order equations.
- **Multiple numerical methods:**  
  - Eulerâ€™s Method  
  - Runge-Kutta (2nd and 4th order)  
  - Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF45, adaptive)  
  - Adams-Bashforth (explicit, 4th order)  
  - Adams-Moulton (implicit, 4th order)  
  - Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF, 2nd order)  
  - Verlet and Symplectic (Stormer-Verlet) for physics/engineering
- **Interactive input:**  
  - Enter ODE system as a Python lambda function  
  - Custom initial conditions, time interval, and step size
- **Visualization:**  
  - Solution plots for all variables  
  - Phase space plots for 2D+ systems  
  - Downloadable results table
- **Usage chart:**  
  - Quick reference for each methodâ€™s order, stability, and industry applications

## Usage

1. **Enter your ODE system** as a Python lambda function.  
   Example for y'' = -y :  
   ```python
   lambda t, X: [X[1], -X[0]]
   ```
2. **Set initial conditions** (comma-separated, e.g. `1, 0` for $$ y(0)=1, y'(0)=0 $$).
3. **Choose a numerical method** from the sidebar.
4. **Adjust time span and step size** as needed.
5. **View solution plots and download results.**
